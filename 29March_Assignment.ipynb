    "Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression is a type of linear regression that uses L1 regularization to shrink the coefficients of the model. This shrinkage can help to reduce overfitting and improve the interpretability of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso regression differs from other regression techniques in two key ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Variable selection:** Lasso regression can perform automatic feature selection, which means that it can identify the most important features for predicting the target variable. This is done by shrinking the coefficients of unimportant features to zero.\n",
    "* **Regularization:** Lasso regression uses L1 regularization, which adds a penalty term to the cost function of the model. This penalty term is proportional to the absolute value of the coefficients. This encourages the model to have a smaller number of non-zero coefficients, which can help to reduce overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other regression techniques, such as ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, do not perform variable selection or regularization. This can lead to models that overfit the training data and are not generalizable to new data.\n",
